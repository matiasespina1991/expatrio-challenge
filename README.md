# Expatrio Challenge App

## Description
This project is a Flutter application developed as part of a challenge to implement a login system and tax data update functionality for the Expatrio platform. The app allows users to authenticate, view a call-to-action to update their tax information, and edit this information through a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Log in using Expatrio credentials.
- **Tax Data Update**: Users can update their tax information, including taxation country and tax identification number.
- **Multiple Taxation Countries Management**: Users can add and manage tax information for multiple countries.
- **Local and Backend Storage**: Tax data is stored locally and synced with the backend.

## Technologies Used
- Flutter for UI development.
- Provider for state management.
- Flutter Secure Storage for secure storage of tokens and sensitive data.
- HTTP for network communications.
